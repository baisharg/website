# Story 1.1: Repository Setup and Initial Structure

## Status
Ready for Review

## Context
This is a complete rebuild from scratch of the BAISH website. Previous implementation files have been removed (commit 68858cd: "Start fresh rebuild: Remove all files except PRD"). This new implementation follows the updated architecture documentation and standards.

**IMPORTANT ARCHITECTURAL DECISION:** This story follows the directory structure defined in the Architecture Documentation (`/assets/css`, `/assets/js`, etc.) which supersedes the original Epic 1 AC #2 structure in the PRD. The Architecture docs represent the more recent and detailed specification, and all stories will follow this structure.

## Story

**As a** developer,  
**I want** to create the Git repository with proper structure and configuration,  
**so that** the project has version control and organized file structure from the start.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Git repository initialized with appropriate .gitignore for web projects
2. Directory structure created following architecture specs:
   - `/assets/css` - Stylesheets directory
   - `/assets/js` - JavaScript files directory  
   - `/assets/images` - Image assets directory
   - `/assets/fonts` - Font files directory
   - `/components` - Web Components directory
   - `/i18n` - Internationalization directory
   - `/docs` - Documentation directory
3. README.md created with project name, description, and setup instructions
4. License file added (MIT or as specified)
5. Basic index.html with "Hello BAISH" message and proper HTML5 structure
6. Repository pushed to GitHub with main branch as default

  - [ ] Verify main branch is set as default on GitHub

## Dev Notes

### Project Structure Details
[Source: ui-architecture/project-structure.md]

The project uses a specific directory structure for the static site:
- `/` - Root contains all HTML pages
- `/assets/` - Contains all static assets organized by type:
  - `/assets/css/` - Stylesheets (base.css, layout.css, components.css, theme.css, animations.css)
  - `/assets/js/` - JavaScript files (app.js, config.js, router.js, utils/)
  - `/assets/images/` - Image assets organized in subdirectories (team/, logos/, icons/, og/)
  - `/assets/fonts/` - Local font files for Oxanium and Space Grotesk
- `/components/` - Web Components organized by type (base/, layout/, ui/, embeds/)
- `/i18n/` - Internationalization files (es.json, en.json, i18n.js)
- `/docs/` - Documentation files

### Technology Stack
[Source: ui-architecture/frontend-tech-stack.md]

- **Framework**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) - No build process needed
- **Styling**: CSS Custom Properties (CSS3) - No preprocessor
- **State Management**: LocalStorage + Events (Native browser APIs)
- **Routing**: Hash-based routing (Native, works with GitHub Pages)
- **Testing**: Browser DevTools for manual testing
- **Dev Tools**: VS Code + Live Server for local development

### Critical Development Standards
[Source: ui-architecture/frontend-developer-standards.md]

1. **NO BUILD PROCESS** - Direct file serving for GitHub Pages
2. **FILE PATHS** - Always use absolute paths or ./ relative
3. **NO TYPESCRIPT** - Use JSDoc for type hints if needed
4. **VANILLA CSS** - Use custom properties, no preprocessors
5. **GITHUB PAGES** - Compatible with static hosting constraints

### Initial HTML Structure Requirements
[Source: PRD Technical Assumptions]

- Static HTML pages for all content (no SSG needed)
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity (no framework/build process)
- CSS3 with multiple stylesheets for modular styling
- Site must work without JavaScript (progressive enhancement)
- Modern browsers only (last 2 versions), no IE11 support

### Repository Configuration
[Source: PRD Technical Assumptions]

- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages with custom domain (baish.com.ar) via CNAME
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub as remote repository
- **Main Branch**: Use 'main' as default branch (not 'master')
- **No Package Manager**: No npm/yarn dependencies initially

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-06

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA) - Ultra-Think Level Review

### Code Quality Assessment

**Outstanding implementation** of the foundational repository setup story. The developer demonstrated excellent judgment by correctly prioritizing the Architecture Documentation structure over the original PRD specifications, showing mature understanding of evolving requirements. The implementation is clean, well-documented, and properly structured for a static site without build processes.

Key strengths identified:
- Perfect alignment with architecture specifications for directory structure
- Comprehensive documentation with clear setup instructions
- Proper HTML5 semantic structure with meta tags for SEO/social sharing
- Forward-thinking preparation for future features (CSS/JS links already in place)
- Clean Git configuration with thorough .gitignore patterns
- Excellent communication in Dev Notes about architectural decisions

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: .gitignore
  - **Change**: Removed duplicate '*~' entry that appeared on both lines 12 and 31
  - **Why**: Duplicates can cause confusion and indicate lack of attention to detail
  - **How**: Cleaner, more maintainable ignore file without redundancy

- **File**: .gitignore
  - **Change**: Added .bmad-core/ and .claude/ to ignored directories
  - **Why**: These development/agent directories were visible in git status but not ignored
  - **How**: Prevents accidental commits of development-specific files

- **File**: README.md
  - **Change**: Removed Python 2 SimpleHTTPServer reference
  - **Why**: Python 2 reached end-of-life in 2020; keeping obsolete instructions causes confusion
  - **How**: Simplified instructions focus only on current Python 3 approach

- **File**: README.md
  - **Change**: Fixed GitHub URL placeholder from [your-username] to 'baish'
  - **Why**: Placeholders in documentation should be replaced with actual values
  - **How**: Provides accurate clone command for users

- **File**: README.md
  - **Change**: Removed heart emoji from footer
  - **Why**: Project guidelines specify no emojis in code/documentation
  - **How**: Maintains consistency with project standards

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ All web standards followed, semantic HTML5, proper file organization
- Project Structure: ✓ Perfect match with architecture documentation specifications
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive validation checklist provided and followed
- All ACs Met: ✓ AC 1-5 fully implemented, AC 6 pending manual GitHub push

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Cleaned up .gitignore duplicate entries and added missing dev directories
- [x] Updated README to remove obsolete Python 2 references
- [x] Fixed README placeholder URLs and removed emoji per standards
- [ ] Consider adding skip navigation link for accessibility (future story)
- [ ] Consider adding ARIA landmarks for better screen reader support (future story)
- [ ] Verify GitHub repository push and branch configuration (manual action required)

### Security Review

**No security concerns identified**
- No sensitive data exposed in committed files
- Proper .gitignore patterns for environment files and credentials
- No hardcoded API keys or passwords
- Static site architecture inherently secure

### Performance Considerations

**Excellent performance foundation**
- Static files with no build process ensures optimal loading
- Proper use of defer attribute on script tags
- Clean HTML structure with minimal overhead
- Ready for CDN/caching strategies when deployed to GitHub Pages

Future optimization opportunities (not blocking):
- Add DNS prefetch/preconnect hints when external resources are added
- Consider web app manifest for PWA capabilities
- Implement resource hints for critical CSS when stylesheets are added

### Ultra-Think Deep Analysis

During this ultra-detailed review, I examined:
- 79 lines of .gitignore for patterns and redundancy
- Complete HTML5 structure and meta tag implementation
- Directory structure alignment with architecture documentation
- README completeness and accuracy of instructions
- License file correctness and copyright details
- Git configuration and branch structure
- Compliance with all development standards and guidelines

The implementation exceeds expectations for a foundational story, demonstrating thorough understanding of the project architecture and requirements.

### Final Status

✓ **Approved - Ready for Done** (pending manual GitHub push verification)

This story provides a rock-solid foundation for the BAISH website rebuild. The minor refactoring performed enhances maintainability without changing functionality. Once the GitHub repository push is completed and verified (Task 6), this story can be marked as Done.
