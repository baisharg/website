# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- **Create a bilingual platform** for AI safety research and education serving the Argentina/LATAM community
- **Establish BAISH as the regional hub** for AI safety initiatives and community building
- **Provide accessible educational resources** through courses, discussion groups, and learning paths
- **Connect local talent** with global AI safety research and opportunities
- **Build community engagement** through events, newsletter, and social media presence

## Background Context

Buenos Aires AI Safety Hub (BAISH) addresses the critical need for AI safety awareness and research capacity in Latin America. As AI development accelerates globally, the region lacks dedicated organizations focused on ensuring beneficial AI development. BAISH fills this gap by providing education, community building, and research opportunities specifically tailored to the Spanish-speaking community, while maintaining connections to the global AI safety ecosystem through bilingual content and international partnerships.
