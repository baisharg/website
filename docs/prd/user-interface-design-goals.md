# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

Create an intellectually engaging yet approachable digital experience that bridges the gap between cutting-edge AI safety research and community education. The interface should feel modern and technically sophisticated while remaining welcoming to newcomers. The design should reinforce BAISH's position as a serious research institution while maintaining the warmth and accessibility needed for community building in Latin America.
